# Machine-Learning-Portfolio
This repository contains a portfolio of all the machine learning and data science projects that I have worked on during my academic years as well as kaggle competition codes that i have participated in.


## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Classifying Event Camera Gestures Data](https://github.com/MyraAdra/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/main/Gesture_Classification.ipynb): A model that classifies gestures from an event camera into one of 11 gesture classes using the DVS128 Gesture Dataset. It is my submission for a kaggle competition. The data for this model is availavble in the Data Directory

  - [Plant Classification Model](https://github.com/MyraAdra/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/main/Plant%20Classification%20Model.ipynb): A plant classification model using the Pl@ntNet Dataset.The public part of this dataset contains 306,293 images of 1081 different species.However, in the scope of this model, a subset of that public set is used: 140,256 images from 153 species. Data for this model isn't available due to its large size (15 gb).
